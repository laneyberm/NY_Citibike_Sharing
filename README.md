# NY_Citibike_Sharing

## Project Overview
###  Kate is trusting you to put together a strong presentation for the investors, so you're trying to think like one. What might the key costs be in a bike-share business? You mull over this question until inspiration strikes: beyond the initial setup, bike maintenance will likely be one of the biggest expenses. So, what can the data tell us about the upkeep bikes might need? A likely concern of investors is the cost of bike upkeep. The bikes used most frequently will probably be the ones that require the most maintenance, so we'll need to determine which bikes have the highest sum of "Number of Rides."

Your investors are curious about the bike utilization during the month of August. You'll need to show the utilization of each Citi Bike in New York City. This will continue to help you understand the needs of a bike-sharing business in Des Moines. Now that we've found the number of trips per bike during the month of August, we should figure out how long those rides are and if there are bikes that need more attention than others. We'll use the bike ID as a metric for this part of the analysis and create a packed bubbles visualization. 

### In this project, we will
